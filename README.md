I gained hands-on experience through various internships, significantly enhancing my skills in web development, AI, and software engineering. As a Web Developer at Alhansat Technologies (Dec 2023 - Jan 2024), I helped develop a task management tool, creating a user-friendly homepage and integrating AI features to prioritise tasks based on user behaviour and urgency. As a Java Developer at Edugene Technologies (Sep 2023 - Nov 2023), I developed a multi-tier Employee Management System using Spring Boot, streamlining HR processes and enabling real-time updates with WebSockets. At Persist Ventures (Aug 2023 - Oct 2023) as a Frontend Developer, I contributed to a website for neighbour communication, enhancing user engagement with interactive forms and optimising the platform for mobile devices. Additionally, I developed websites for clients as a freelancer, further refining my web development skills.
